    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun game for two players.</p>
    <p>The goal is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, either</p>
    <p>horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.</p>

    <h1>INSTRUCTION</h1>
    <p>Player 1 starts by placing an "X" in one of the empty boxes.</p>
    <p>Player 2 then places an "O" in one of the remaining empty boxes.</p>
    <p>Players take turns marking a square until one of the following happens:</p>
    <p>A player wins by placing three of their marks in a row,</p>
    <p>either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
    <p>The game ends in a draw if all boxes are filled and no player has won.</p>
    <p>After a game is over, click the Play Again button to start a new game.</p>
